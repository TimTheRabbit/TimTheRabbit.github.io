Hint for adventurer
-----------------
Here's some hint for your amazing adventure.

But you're an explorer,

so you need to find out something by yourself.

First of all,the four corner of level 1 may hide something important.

Next,the yellow coin and the blue "square shape" thing might be helpful.

At last,a wooden building is good to go inside from the back!!!
